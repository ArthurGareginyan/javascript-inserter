Easily and safely add your custom JavaScript code to your WordPress website, directly out of the WordPress Admin Area, without the need to have an external editor.


== Description ==

An easy to use, with intuitive interface, WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to easily and safely add your custom JavaScript code to your WordPress website, directly out of the WordPress Admin Area, without the need to have an external editor.

This is a must have tool for authors and website's owners. Its purpose is to provide a familiar experience to WordPress users. There is no need for any more editing of the files of your theme or plugins for to add custom JavaScript code. Just add your custom JavaScript code in the field on the plugin page and this plugin will do the rest for you. It will automatically add your JavaScript code to the desired section of your website, without changing any of your theme files and without slowing down your website.

The plugin works completely independently of the theme, so you can use it with any theme. The code you place on the plugin page will be entirely unaffected if you edit the contents of the theme’s files, or even completely change the theme. This is really useful in case of updating theme or plugins, because your custom JavaScript code would never be overwritten. Your custom JavaScript code will keep on working, no matter how many times you upgrade or switch your theme and plugins.

On the plugin page you find the code editor powered by CodeMirror. This code editor has options such as syntax highlighting, line numbering, and more. And if you want more options, let us know and we will be happy to add them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Will this plugin work on my wordpress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (wordpress.ORG) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. This plugin is ready for translation and has already been translated into several languages. But If your language is not available then you can make one. It is also possible that not all existing translations are up-to-date or correct, so you are welcome to make corrections. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you share your translation with the community. Thanks for your contribution!

If you want to help translate this plugin, please use the POT file that is included and placed in the `languages` folder to create a translation PO file. Just [send the PO file to us](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and we will include this translation within the next plugin update.

= Q. How does it work? =
A. Simply go to the plugin settings page, place your custom JavaScript code in the code editor field and click the "Save changes" button. Enjoy the result of applying your custom JavaScript code. It's that simple!
You can find the plugin settings page at "`WordPress Admin Area`" -> "`Settings`" -> "`JS Inserter`".

= Q. How much of JavaScript code (characters) I can enter in the code editor? =
A. We don't limit the number of characters.

= Q. Does this plugin requires any modification of the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is configurable entirely from the plugin settings page that you can find in the Admin Area of your WordPress website.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using an easy-to-use plugin settings page.

= Q. Can I add my custom JavaScript code to a specific page of my website? =
A. For now, this plugin does not have an option to apply the custom JavaScript code only on specific pages. We plan to add this feature soon. But for now in order to apply your custom JavaScript code only on specific pages of your website, you need to wrap your custom JavaScript code in a PHP code that will determine the page you want. You need something like this:

`function my_custom_js_code() {

    // Stop the function if this is not the Home page of website
    if ( !is_home() ) {
        return;
    }

    // Print the custom JavaScript code
    echo '<script>YOUR CUSTOM JAVASCRIPT CODE HERE</script>';

}
add_action( 'wp_head', 'my_custom_js_code' );`

To apply the PHP code on a website, we can recommend you to use another our plugin called [My Custom Functions](https://wordpress.org/plugins/my-custom-functions/).

= Q. My custom JavaScript code is not working. What could be wrong? =
A. It happens that your custom JavaScript code that you insert on the plugin page does not work, even if an error message does not appear. Here are a few of the most likely causes of the issue:

1. You have a typo during the insertion of your custom JavaScript code.
2. Your custom JavaScript code has a syntax error.
3. Your custom JavaScript code is incorrect and may not work.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly. The most common reason for this is a web browser’s cache. Every web browser stores a cache of the websites you visit (pages, images, and etc.) to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. This is called the browser’s cache. Clearing your browser’s cache may solve the problem.

If you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, we'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.

= Q. The last WordPress update is preventing me from editing my website that is using this plugin. Why is this? =
A. This plugin can not cause such problem. More likely, the problem are related to the settings of the website. It could just be a cache, so please try to clear your website's cache (may be you using a caching plugin, or some web service such as the CloudFlare) and then the cache of your web browser. Also please try to re-login to the website, this too can help.

A. Bug reports are very welcome! Please visit [our contact page](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and report. Thank you!
